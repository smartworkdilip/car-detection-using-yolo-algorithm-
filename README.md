# Autonomous driving application-Car detection using yolo algorithm
 Autonomous Cars have many features and one of them is  car detection .Here in this project i am trying to build a Car detection system using yolo algorithm.
 
 YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes
 
 Libraries I have used is as follows
 
 1)argparse
 
 2)os
 
 3)matplotlib.pyplot
 
 4)tensorflow
 
 5)PIL
 
 6)keras
 
 7)Scipy
 
 8)yolo_utils
 
 9)yad2k.models.keras_yolo

As a sample input i have provided test.jpg file which is normal road side view and output of that image is test_output.jpg which contain all car images in a bounding box.

Thank you.
